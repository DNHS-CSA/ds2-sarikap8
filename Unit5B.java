    Gadget a = new Gadget();

    //A.The code segment does not compile because the setStatus method should be called on an object of the class Gadget, not on the class itself.
    //B.The code segment does not compile because the static variable status is not properly initialized.
    //C.The code segment creates two Gadget objects a and b. The class Gadgetâ€™s static variable status is set to 10, then to 3, and then back to 10.
    //D.The code segment creates two Gadget objects a and b. After executing the code segment, the object a has a status value of 3 and the object b has a status value of 3.
    //E.The code segment creates two Gadget objects a and b. After executing the code segment, the object a has a status value of 3 and the object b has a status value of 10.

    //A and B are untrue because the code segment does compile. 
    //C is right because the Gadget class is setting the value of the variable when 
    //the object is initialized the Gadget constructor is run (same for and b)

    //////////////////////////Q6
    UnitsHandler large = new UnitsHandler(100); 
    // UnitsHandler.update(8);
    
    //A. The code segment does not compile, because it is not possible to create the object large from outside the UnitsHandler class.
    //B. The code segment does not compile, because it attempts to change the values of private variables from outside the UnitsHandler class.
    //C. The code segment does not compile, because the update method should be called on the object large instead of on the UnitsHandler class. 
    //D. The code segment creates a UnitsHandler object called large and sets the static variable unitsPerContainer to 100. The static variables containers and totalUnits each retain the default value 0.
    //E. The code segment creates a UnitsHandler object called large and sets the static variables unitsPerContainer, containers, and totalUnits to 100, 8, and 800, respectively.

    //The code segment does compile correctly, so A B and C are wrong. 
    // The creation of the large object sets the unitsPerContainer to 100. 
    //When the update method is run (compiles bc static), containers = 8
    //and totalUnits = 800. Therefore the answer is E.
